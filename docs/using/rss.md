# RSS Feeds

If you're interested in supporting SciOp by seeding, 
but don't have the space to seed everything, or don't 
want to manually download torrents to seed, many modern 
torrent clients include an option to download torrents 
automatically from an RSS feed. 

With SciOp, you can choose tags to automatically download and seed. 
First, choose a topic, tag, or category to automatically seed from 
[the feeds tab](https://sciop.net/feeds), and then copy the rss feed link. 

There are multiple different clients that do have RSS feed functionality. 
For qbittorrent, you can go to the rss feed tab, and then click new 
subscription, and paste the link you copied in the previous step. Then, 
if you want, you can go to preferences, then rss, and then "edit download 
rules", to set up automatic downloading.
