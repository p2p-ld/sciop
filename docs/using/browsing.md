What's even on this website?

## Kinds Of Things

* A [**Dataset**][sciop.models.Dataset] is the basic unit of information,
  the thing that can be referred to (by its [`slug`](#datasets)),
  and holds all the metadata for an item.
* A dataset may have [**Dataset Parts**][sciop.models.DatasetPart].
  These are subdivisions within a larger dataset to organize datasets
  e.g. that might have periodic updates or independent components.
  Some examples are given [below](#dataset-parts)
* An [**Upload**][sciop.models.Upload] is the juice of the site -
  the container for a torrent file (or, in the future, other formats or sources!).
  This is the unit of organization you would expect from other torrent trackers.
