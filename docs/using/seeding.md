One of the simplest things you can do to help keep some data safe
is to replicate one or more datasets
by downloading and seeding them via BitTorrent.

!!! note "Overview"
	1. Download and install a BitTorrent client
	2. [Browse the site](browsing.md) and find a dataset that you'd like to replicate
	3. Download the torrent file(s) for one or more of your chosen dataset's uploads
	4. Open the torrent files in your BitTorrent client
	5. Leave your BitTorrent client running to seed the dataset for others
