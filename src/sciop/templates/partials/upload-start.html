<p>Make sure you have read the <a href="/docs/uploading">upload guide</a> for how to create your torrent!</p>
<p>
    If your torrent is particularly large (>5MB) or has a large number of files (>20,000), this may take a few moments.
    If you are uploading a scrape of a website, we strongly recommend zipping directories into logical subsets of the scraped pages,
    or zipping them such that each archive is slightly less than your torrent's piece size (which should be a few MB).
